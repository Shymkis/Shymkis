# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Joe Shymanski, and I'm currently a Ph.D. student at the University of Tulsa, where I'm deeply involved in a variety of projects. My repositories are a testament to my diverse interests and skills, ranging from optimization problems like Steiner trees, to game solvers like Sudoku, and a plethora of machine learning and artificial intelligence models.
